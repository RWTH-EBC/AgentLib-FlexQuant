This project is a plugin for the [AgentLib](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AgentLib). This agent-based framework employs model predictive control (MPC) to quantify flexibility offers of electricity usage of building energy systems (BES) during operation.

## Installation
To install, you can either use the ``requirements.txt`` or go for package installation with ``pip install -e .``.
The ``-e`` option installs the package in editable mode, which should be done when working on this package. Please use Python version 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12.

## Tutorial
A guide on what the framework does and hoe it can be applied is given in the examples folder or [here](https://rwth-ebc.github.io/AgentLib-FlexQuant/main/docs/tutorials.html).
